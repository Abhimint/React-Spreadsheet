Goals 
    - #1: 2-way/bi-directional bind content between selected input and formula  -- * optional *
        - with more time, this is best to be set up using redux for scalability
    - #2: set the position to be sticky to the window on horizontal scroll
    - #3: update formula bar by adding it as a form with a submit for 
    executing some operations on submit - done
        - a: form should be able to add two number in the form
            - input should have onChange function that checks if two numbers are present 
    - #4: align form into grid 
*/
/*
Thoughts
    - Upon checking other existing libraries like 'react-datasheet', turns out that none of them 
    have a 'Formula Bar' like mine. Maybe it is because they realized React 
    is unable to do 2-way binding
    - Upon extending the functionality of the operands, the regex will need to be updated
    - Main goal is STILL to get the result from the formula to be displayed in the last focused cell
    - This exercise is REALLY good for string manipulation in js

    //TODO: Build an "allowed" and "not allowed" mode
    /* 3 part process
        - regex to sanitize exactly what is added into the formula
        - string stripping to get + or - from the string and also save the two operands
            - this is also where the condition needs to be that checks if anyone of the operand is
            a cell id
        - function to convert stripped operands into 
            - a number or
            - reference the value from the cell id provided
        and then pass them to another function that accepts the operands, and a param to check what
        kind of a operation it is and then based on a switch case, add or subtract

        -- trying to get the flow to always be
            - write something in a cell first
            - only evaluation should be done in the formula bar
                - for this, always have the '=' sign prefilled by default (onActive)
